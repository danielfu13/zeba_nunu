  ## Project Description

This project is a Note Taking app that can be used to write and save notes. I modified the starter code given to create an application that uses Express.js back end to save and retrieve data from a JSON file. Users are able to create notes and save it on their local, so that they can view their saved notes even after they have closed the app.
